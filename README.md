I am Benjamin Lau Rey Jun 😃. I am from Singapore, and I'm currently a Year 3 student in DigiPen studying CS in Interactive Media and Game Development 🏫. I love exploring all things design and tech!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my DigiPen Game Project 3 titled "Last Frame", a PC-mobile cross-platform horror game that utilizes gyroscoping for looking around in the mobile version!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the technical differences in developing the controls for android mobile as compared to PC.
- 👯 I’m looking for an internship for my Internship Work Study Program (IWSP) next year, starting in May!
