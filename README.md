## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benjamin, and I'm currently a Year 3 student in DigiPen studying CS in Interactive Media and Game Development!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my DigiPen Game Project 3 called "Last Frame", which is a PC-mobile cross-platform horror game that utilizes gyroscoping for the mobile version.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the technical differences in developing the controls for android mobile as compared to PC.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for an internship for my Internship Work Study Program (IWSP) next year, starting in May!
